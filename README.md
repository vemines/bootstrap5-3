# Bootstrap 5.3

## What is Bootstrap

Bootstrap 5 is widely used in front-end development to create responsive, mobile-first websites. It offers a rich set of pre-built components and a powerful grid system, making layout design straightforward. By integrating Bootstrap, developers can quickly build and deploy a polished, responsive UI with minimal custom CSS or JavaScript. It’s perfect for creating consistent, accessible user interfaces with less effort.

## Overview

This project is designed for learning purposes, making it easier to understand and apply Bootstrap for building responsive, modern web interfaces. Based on the official [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/). It showcases a collection of components with practical examples for hands-on experimentation.

**Note:** aria attributes, roles, and other non-UI elements have been removed simplify the code for learning. However, it is recommended to understand and implement accessibility features in production projects. For full examples, refer to the official documentation.
